# Overview
This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges designed to practice problem-solving skills in JavaScript. Each challenge addresses a real-world scenario and requires user interaction for inputs.

# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Description:
A program that prompts the user to input a student's marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

A: Marks > 79
B: Marks 60 to 79
C: Marks 50 to 59
D: Marks 40 to 49
E: Marks < 40

# How to Run:
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
Input the student's marks (between 0 and 100) when prompted.
View the output displaying the grade.

# Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Description:
If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints:
If the speed exceeds 70 km/h, it calculates demerit points.
For every 5 km/h above 70, 1 demerit point is added.
If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, it prints:
License suspended

# How to Run:
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
node speedDetector.js
Input the car's speed when prompted.
View the output displaying either "Ok," the number of demerit points, or "License suspended."

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Description:program that evaluates a car's speed and provides feedback based on the following conditions:

A program that calculates an individualâ€™s net salary based on the following inputs:

Basic Salary
Benefits
The program computes:

PAYE (Tax) based on current tax brackets.
NHIF Deductions based on gross salary.
NSSF Deductions (Tier I and Tier II).
Gross Salary (basic salary + benefits).
Net Salary (gross salary - deductions).

# How to Run:
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
Input the basic salary and benefits when prompted.
